        My name is Madison, I am a native to the Atlanta area and wouldn't have it any other way. I knew at a very young age that hair and beauty is my passion. From growing up in the suburbs, to spending much of my adult life in different parts of the city, I have a massive appreciation for different cultures and styles. I am inspired by the world around me, whether it's the street art and sculptures on the Beltline or being surrounded by nature in the mountains. Just like the graffiti in the city and the sunlight peering through the trees, I love to create a balance between the bold and soft looks I give each individual in my chair. 
        I studied cosmetology at the Aveda Institute of Atlanta in 2013 and have been doing hair ever since. I specialize in all Blonding and color services. It will always be my priority to not only work with, but to educate my guests on the natural and beneficial products we use at Citrine. My first love was cutting; creating shapes and seeing hair move the way it was meant to. That was, until I started playing with color. I am passionate about creating personalized styles that fit into the lives of each of my guests. The sweet combination of perfectly placed color with a fresh haircut, THAT is my happy place and I canâ€™t wait to share that with you! 
        Away from the salon, I take pride in being the best mom I can be to my son, Remi Wilde and his furry sister, Winter. I enjoy spending time in nature, hiking, camping, and just simply unplugging from this fast paced world we live in. Music and art, I hold very close to my soul and are all vital when I decompress after a long day.
        Let's Rock n' Roll!`,

        I'm Lindsay and co-owner of Citrine Hair Studio! I've been a hairstylist since 2007 and wouldn't have it any other way. I'm grateful that I found something that I am truly passionate about and get to pour my heart and soul into, day after day. One reason I love being a hairstylist is socializing with my guests. I live for those deep conversations and the times when we can really connect. It's in my DNA to care for people and the feeling of nurturing another person and making them see their beauty is very fulfilling to me. That being said, the creative aspect of hair is also an outlet. Allowing myself to envision something for you creatively, all the while using the scientific and systematic aspects of hair coloring and cutting. It hits all the marks for me!
        Furthering my education as a stylist is absolutely vital. Just like fashion, hair trends are ever evolving. Techniques and products are constantly being created and invented. I consider it my duty as a hair professional to keep up to date on all things hair.
        When I'm not in the salon, you can most likely find me outside, spooning my dog, pumping iron, or listening to a true crime podcast. I have a husband and a dog (Tobbe and Big Luke) and we love to take adventures whether it be hiking, rock climbing, or biking. I also love music. Listening to it, creating my own, and nerding out with others about it!`,
